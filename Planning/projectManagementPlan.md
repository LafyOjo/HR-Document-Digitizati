# Project Management Plan

Our plan for managing the project includes iteration planning, meetings, communication and a gantt chart      

## Details of Plan

* **Iteration Planning**
    * This is when a team and its members establish how much of a project can be completed and delivered within an iteration of the project. 
    * Iterations are to be weekly, with tasks being split so that they take no more than one week. 
    * In our case, our group members can decide which part of the plan they wish to execute, and allow tasks to cascade from "Yet to Start" to "Completed", as can be seen in the meeting documents. 
    * For our team to succeed with iteration planning, we must have regular meeting, where we discuss and write down future plans in depth
    so when it comes to actually getting to these stages, we would already have knowledge regarding the topic, so it will
    be easier to execute.
    
* **Meetings**
    * We are planning to have meetings bi-Weekly, one at the beginning of the week to set up what work needs to be done 
      for the week (Tuesday 13:00) and one at the end of the week to check the progress of our work and get feedback from 
      the rest of the group (Friday 16:00).
    * These meetings will be documented within .md files, this include the minutes of the meeting, the work that needs 
      to be done, the work that has been completed since the last week and any amendments to the current plan or feedback.
    * The template for the meeting file is stored on gitLab. 
* **Communications**
    * Our group will communicate between meetings via a group chat on WhatsApp. 
* **Gantt Chart**
    * We will use a gantt chart on Excel Spreadsheet to track our progress on tasks and the whole project to ensure we stick to our pre-determined timeline. 
    * The gantt chart will be updated in the Friday meetings after we have reviewed work completed during the week.
