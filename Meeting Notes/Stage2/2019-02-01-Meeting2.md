* Authentication
    * Is manager necessary, as they are a subclass of employee?
* Personal Details
    * Should the user be able to amend their own personal details?
* Review
    * Should HR be able to read review records?
    * Should a being reviewed actor be present?
    * Should the Reviewer be able to create new documents?
    * Should the perform review use case require authorisation?
    * Should perform review include Create New Review record?
