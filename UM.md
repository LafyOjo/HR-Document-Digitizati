## Personal Details Documents
-  Personal details documents are accessible to the employee they pertain to and members of HR. 
- Employees can change their own Personal Details documents, but not create them.
- These documents must be created by a user with HR employee level access, (HR employees and the director of HR).

## Annual Reviews
- Annual review documents are created by the employee that is being reviewed.
- The first reviewer is always the employee's direct superior. 
- In order to create the document the employee must first have a second reviewer assigned to them by a member of HR.
- Reviewers can enter reviewer mode which will stay in place until they log out of the system. This will allow them to edit review documents for employees they are assigned to. 
- Once the document is created, the three members of the review can all edit the document.
- Once the review is considered complete, all three members should sign the review by entering their name.
- A completed and fully signed review becomes read only, and cannot be edited further.
